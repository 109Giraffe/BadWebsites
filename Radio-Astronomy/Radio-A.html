<title>109Giraffes' Radio Astronomy</title>
<t1 style="text-align:centre;">Introduction</t1>
<p style="text-align:centre;">
This is a website about a radio astronomy project that I am working on. This includes; information about what 
radio astronomy even is and why I got into it. This website will also include a link to my Github where you may
download files to copy this setup.</p>
<t2 style="text-align:centre;">What is radio astronomy?</t2>
<p style="text-align:centre;">Radio astronomy is a brach of astronomy where radio telescopes are used to study 
radio waves emitted by celestial objects. It alows us to observe phenomena that are invisible to the human eye 
and optical telescopes. By analyzing these radio signals we can see factors like the compositions and the structures 
of objects in space.</p> 
<t2 style="text-align:centre;">How does it work</p>
<p style="text-align:centre;">By making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_telescope">Radio Telescope</a>
(A directional radio antenna) and pointing it where you want to receive,you can detect fluctuations and emissions 
in the electromagnetic spectrum typically around 30 meters to 3 meters (10-100Mhz).Typical frequencies include;</p>
